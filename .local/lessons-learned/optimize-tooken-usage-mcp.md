*Key Takeaways and Recommendations:**

- **Be Selective:** Don't connect every MCP server to every AI tool.
- **Prioritize Code:** More actual code context is generally more beneficial to the AI than extensive MCP server -efinitions.
- **Explore CLI:** Investigate if CLI tools can achieve the same functionality as MCP servers with fewer resources.
- **Optimize Workflow:** By being mindful of MCP server usage, users can reduce costs, avoid rate limits, and improve their AI's ability to understand and assist with their codebase, becoming "AI native engineers."
